After logging in as bandit6, I checked the home directory and found only the usual hidden files like .bashrc and .profile, with no obvious password file in sight.

The challenge required me to find a file that met three conditions:

It’s owned by user bandit7

It belongs to group bandit6

Its size is exactly 33 bytes

To locate this file system-wide, I ran a find command that searched for files with the right ownership and size:

find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null

Most directories threw permission errors (which were hidden using 2>/dev/null), but eventually I found a match in:

/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

I navigated to that location and attempted to read it. At first, I tried splitting the filename by mistake (cat bandit7 password), which didn’t work. Then I realized it was a single filename with a dot, so I used:

cat bandit7.password

That revealed the password for the next level:

morbNTDKSW6j1Uc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaJ

With that, I was ready to move on to Bandit Level 7.
