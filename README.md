# DevOps-Learning---Linux-Module.
Linux Module – DevOps Learning Journal
When I think of Linux, the first word that comes to mind is "complex"—but in a good way. Linux is like a powerful toolbox that gives you deep control over a computing system. Unlike graphical interfaces that abstract everything away, Linux allows you to interact directly with the operating system, navigating and manipulating files, processes, and networks with precision.

What stands out most to me is how Linux enables users to create their own pathways—you’re not limited to doing things one "default" way. Whether it's scripting, file manipulation, or process management, there's often more than one valid approach. This flexibility is both empowering and humbling.

One of the most fascinating aspects is how Linux can be used to identify encryption methods, debug systems, and even dig into hidden or misconfigured files. It’s like being given the keys to look under the hood of a machine that most people just drive.

During the OverTheWire: Bandit challenges, I used a variety of commands to explore, manipulate, and retrieve information from the system. Some of the most frequently used commands included:

ls – to list files in a directory

cd – to change directories

cat – to read file contents

file – to identify file types

du – to estimate file space usage

find – to search for files and directories

grep – to search within files for specific patterns

ssh – to securely connect to remote systems

chmod – to change file permissions

nc (netcat) – for reading and writing data across networks

base64, xxd, strings – for decoding and analyzing file contents

These challenges pushed me to understand not just how to use commands, but why they work. Each task required me to think critically about system structure, file permissions, encoding schemes, and more.

Learning Linux has shown me that DevOps isn’t just about automating systems—it's about understanding them deeply. And Linux, for all its complexity, is the perfect environment for developing that understanding.
