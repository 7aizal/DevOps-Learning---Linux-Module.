After logging in as bandit15, I found the password for the next level inside the usual file:


/etc/bandit_pass/bandit16
I copied it:
8xCjmnqoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tkJxQo

The challenge required me to connect to a service running on localhost over SSL, on one of the ports between 31000 and 32000. The goal was to find the service that accepted the password and returned an SSH private key for the next level.

Step 1: Port Scanning
I used nmap to find open ports in the target range:


nmap localhost -p 31000-32000
This returned a few open ports, including 31046, 31518, 31691, 31790, and 31960.

Step 2: Testing Services over SSL
Using ncat, I tested each port over SSL:


ncat --ssl localhost <port>
Eventually, I hit success on port 31790. It prompted me for a password. I entered the one from /etc/bandit_pass/bandit16, and the server responded with:


Correct!
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
This was the SSH private key for bandit17.

Step 3: Preparing the Key for Use
I copied the entire private key into a file in /tmp, using nano:


nano /tmp/private.key
After saving it, I had to set the right permissions for SSH to accept it:


chmod 700 private.key
Step 4: Logging in as bandit17
Initially, I tried:


ssh bandit17@localhost -i private.key
But this failed because Bandit SSH runs on port 2220, not the default port 22.

So I corrected it with:


ssh -i private.key bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
This time, the login was successful, and I was now bandit17.
