After logging in as bandit5, I went into the inhere directory, which contained 20 subdirectories named maybehere00 through maybehere19.

Each of these folders potentially held the password, but checking them one by one would be inefficient. I listed all the directories with ls -l to get more details, but that alone wasn’t enough.

To narrow it down, I used the find command with some specific conditions:

The file had to be readable,

Its size had to be exactly 1033 bytes, and

It shouldn’t be executable.

The command I used was:

find . -type f -readable -size 1033c ! -executable
This returned one result:
./maybehere07/.file2

I opened that file with cat and found the password for the next level:

HWsMrQXe8KqdUmM9JNsGNuVZ1T5Tnfjp

With the correct file identified, I was ready to log in as bandit6.
