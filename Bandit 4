After logging in as bandit3, I listed the contents of the home directory using ls. 

I saw a folder named inhere, so I changed into that directory with cd inhere/.

Inside, I wanted to see all files, including hidden ones, so I used 

ls -a. That revealed a hidden file named 
...Hiding–From–You.

Since the file name started with dots and included dashes, I used 
cat ...Hiding–From–You to read its contents. 
It worked, and I retrieved the password for the next level:

I was then ready to move on to Bandit Level 4.
