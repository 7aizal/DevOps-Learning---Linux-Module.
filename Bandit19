After logging in as bandit18, I found a file named bandit20-do in the home directory. The goal was to read the contents of /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20, which I couldn’t access directly due to permission restrictions.

Step 1: Checking Permissions
I verified that trying to read the file directly using:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
resulted in a “Permission denied” error. Running id showed I was user bandit19 with no access to bandit20’s files.

Step 2: Investigating the Setuid Binary
I then ran:


file bandit20-do
This revealed it was a setuid ELF executable, which allows running a command as another user—in this case, as bandit20.

Running the binary without arguments confirmed the syntax:


./bandit20-do <command>
Step 3: Running the Command as bandit20
I used the binary to run id and confirmed it executed with bandit20's privileges:


./bandit20-do id
Then, I used it to read the password file:


./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
This successfully printed the password for the next level:


oQXahG8ZJ0VMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbY0
With that, I was ready to log in as bandit20.
