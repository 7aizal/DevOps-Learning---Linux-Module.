After logging in as bandit10, I saw a file named data.txt. I opened it and noticed that the contents looked like Base64-encoded textâ€”it ended with ==, which is a strong hint.

To confirm, I ran:

base64 data.txt

This returned a decoded string, further confirming it was indeed Base64-encoded. To get the actual password, I decoded it using:

base64 -d data.txt

The output revealed the password:

dtR19fZkB0RRsDFGSCg2RWnwpNVj3qRr

With that, I was ready to move on to Bandit Level 11.
