After logging in as bandit2, I ran:


ls
This showed a file named:


spaces in this filename
Since the filename had spaces, I knew I couldn't just type it directly with cat or it would interpret each word as a separate argument. So, I wrapped the filename in quotes to treat it as a single string:


cat "spaces in this filename"
That worked, and it printed the password for the next level:


MNK8KN3Usiio4lPRUEoDFPqfxLPLSmx
After that, I exited the session to move on to Bandit Level 3
