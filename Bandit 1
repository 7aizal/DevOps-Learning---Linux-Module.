I started by connecting to the Bandit server and landing in the home directory of bandit0.

First, I wanted to see what files were there, so I ran:


-ls
This showed me there was a file called readme.

To see what was inside the file, I used:


-cat readme
When I displayed the contents, I found a message congratulating me and, most importantly, it included the password for the next level:


The password you are looking for is: ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If
With this password, I was ready to log in as bandit1 to continue to the next level.
