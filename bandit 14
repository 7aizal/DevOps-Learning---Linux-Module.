fter logging in as bandit13, I found a file named sshkey.private in the home directory. The goal was to use this private key to log into the bandit14 account.

Step 1: Attempting SSH with Private Key
I first tried connecting with:

css
Copy
Edit
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost
That failed because the Bandit server doesn’t use the default SSH port 22—it uses port 2220.

So I updated the command:

css
Copy
Edit
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost -p 2220
This time, the connection worked, and I was able to log in as bandit14.

Step 2: Retrieving the Password
Once in the bandit14 account, I read the password file as usual:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
The password I received was:

nginx
Copy
Edit
MU4VWeTyJk8RQfo1qmcoBPAhL7DLCPvS
With this, I was ready to proceed to Bandit Level 15.
