After logging in as bandit16, I found two files in the home directory:

passwords.old

passwords.new

The challenge hinted that only one line had changed between the two versions, and the new password was likely the one that was added or modified.

To find the difference, I used the diff command:


diff passwords.new passwords.old
The output pointed to line 42 and showed the line that existed in the new file but not in the old one:


< x2gLTtTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGL0
That line was the password for the next level:


x2gLTtTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGL0
With that, I was ready to log in as bandit17.
