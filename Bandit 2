After logging in as bandit1, I ran:


ls
This showed me a single file named - (just a dash). At first glance, that looked odd—it’s easy to mistake it for an option flag, which made me realize I couldn’t access it the normal way.

At first, I tried:


cat ./
That gave me an error: Is a directory, which made sense because ./ just refers to the current directory.

Then I tried:


cat ./-
By specifying the file with a relative path (./-), I avoided confusing the dash with a command-line option. That worked—it printed out the password for the next level:

Now I’m ready to log in as bandit2 using this password.
