After logging in as bandit19, my goal was to send the password for bandit20 to a listening service that would then return the password for bandit21.

I found a setuid binary named suconnect in the home directory. This file was owned by bandit20, so it was likely used to securely send a message to bandit21’s system.

Step 1: Prepare a Listener
At first, I attempted to use nc (netcat) to open a listener on a port:


nc -l -p 786
But I received Permission denied, likely due to restricted low ports or nc capabilities.

Eventually, I tried a higher port:


nc -l -p 1786
This worked—I was able to run a listener that would print anything sent to it.

Step 2: Test the suconnect Binary
I examined the binary and discovered it was executable and ran with bandit20’s privileges.

So I ran:


./suconnect 1786
It prompted me to enter the bandit20 password, which I pasted in:


oQXahG8ZJ0VMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbY0
The script read the password, confirmed it, and sent the next one through the socket. On the nc listener, I received:


EeoUMCra2q0dSkYj561DX7s1CpBuOBt
That was the password for bandit21.
