After logging in as bandit13, I found a file in the home directory named sshkey.private, which was a private SSH key.

The goal for this level was to log into the bandit14 account using that key. I couldn’t use a password—SSH key authentication was required.

To proceed, I used the ssh command with the -i option to specify the key file. Initially, I tried:

ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost

But this failed because SSH tried to connect through the default port 22, which isn’t used in the Bandit game.

So I re-ran the command with the correct port (2220):

ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost -p 2220

This successfully connected me to the bandit14 account.

Once logged in, I retrieved the password for the next level by reading the usual password file:

cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14

The password was:

MU4JVVeJYKs8RKAgV3hBLvdcfk7xLY4a

With that, I was ready to move on to Bandit Level 14.
