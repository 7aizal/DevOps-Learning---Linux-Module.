After logging in as bandit7, I found a file named data.txt in the home directory. The level hint mentioned that the password for the next level is the only line in the file that occurs exactly once.

I knew that manually scanning a large file wasnâ€™t efficient, so I used the grep command to search for the word "millionth", which was likely a clue:

grep millionth data.txt

This returned a single line:

millionth dfWVzFQi4Um0wNFbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc

That line showed the word "millionth" followed by the actual password:

dfWVzFQi4Um0wNFbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc

With that, I was ready to move on to Bandit Level 8.
